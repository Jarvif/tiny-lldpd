# tiny-lldpd

This is a minimal LLDP (802.1AB) daemon for Linux machines.
Should be a good starting point for writing your own LLDP application.

## How to use
Just run `make all` to build tiny-lldpd. Start it with `sudo ./tlldpd`.
Following options are supported:
- `-D` - Run in the foreground, not as daemon.
- `-d` - Allow multiple starts.
- `-i <interval>` - Set interval of LLDP announcements in seconds.
